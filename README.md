About Java
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

Key Features of Java
Object-Oriented: Java is purely object-oriented, which allows for building modular programs and reusable code.

Platform Independent: When Java is compiled, it is not compiled into a platform-specific machine, but rather into platform-independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

Simple: Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.

Secure: With Java's secure feature, it enables the development of virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

Robust: Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly compile-time error checking and runtime checking.

Multithreaded: With Java's multithreaded feature, it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.

High Performance: With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.

Applications of Java
Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms, from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. Common applications include:

Desktop GUI Applications

Mobile Applications (especially Android apps)

Web-based Applications

Enterprise Applications (e.g., banking applications)

Scientific Applications

Big Data Technologies

Gaming Applications

Installation Guide
To compile and run the Java programs in this repository, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

Windows:
Download the latest JDK from the Oracle website.

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
