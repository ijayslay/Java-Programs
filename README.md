# Java-Programs
What is Java?
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for flexibility, reliability, and portability. It follows the “Write Once, Run Anywhere” principle, allowing compiled code to run on any platform supporting Java without modification.

Features of Java
Object-Oriented: Encourages modular approaches via encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Platform Independent: Java bytecode runs on any system that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Robust & Secure: Designed to avoid crashes and provide secure data handling.

Rich Standard Library: Includes utilities for networking, data structures, GUI, and more.

Multithreading: Supports concurrent execution for performance.

Applications of Java
Web Development: Backend servers and web applications (e.g., using Servlets, JSP).

Mobile Development: Android app development.

Enterprise Applications: Robust frameworks (Spring, Hibernate) for corporate solutions.

Scientific Computing: Tools for research and simulations.

Games and Desktop Apps: Interactive applications and desktop tools.
